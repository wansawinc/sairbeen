## What is this?
Radio Kashmir Srinagar (JK) India telecasts news bulliten over MW on Radio frequency and is avilable on RADIO only. \
Most of people now days use internet and dont have access either do not preffer to listen news on Radio. \
Also people out side kashmir can not listen to MW radio station ( Internet is everywhere) 

This is a small Project to re-stream a 30 minutes of everyday news show from Radio kashmir Srinagar ( RKS ) over internet. \
Anyone can listen to Sairbeen on internet.

Due to limits on social media live streaming Audio only can not be transmitted in order to stream Sairbeen from RKS to social media sites we need to stream as VIDEO, So we produce VIDEO using an static Image and original audio from RKS .
