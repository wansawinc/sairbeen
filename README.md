## Relay sairbeen from Radio kashmir srinager to internet over multiple destinations.
_Source code has been moved to another private repo_ \
If you want to contribute or have concern/query [Create issue](https://github.com/wansawinc/sairbeen/issues)

## What is this?
Radio Kashmir Srinagar (JK) India telecasts news bulliten over MW on Radio frequency and is avilable on RADIO only. \
Most of people now days use internet and dont have access either do not preffer to listen news on Radio. \
Also people out side kashmir can not listen to MW radio station ( Internet is everywhere) 

This is a small Project to re-stream a 30 minutes of everyday news show from Radio kashmir Srinagar ( RKS ) over internet. \
Anyone can listen to Sairbeen on internet.

Due to limits on social media live streaming Audio only can not be transmitted in order to stream Sairbeen from RKS to social media sites we need to stream as VIDEO, So we produce VIDEO using an static Image and original audio from RKS . 

# Update - 29 Sep 2022

We have recently made some changes and also removed streams from all platforms includng Facebook and Youtube.
why? Due to lack of budget we could not pay bill i.e 110$ for transcoding and restreaming. 
We have downgraded our server and only Instagram streams are enabled using on Hetzner AMDx Server that could not transcode and stream with low leteracy on multiple destinations.

We have also removed donations pages and donate.wansaw.com will be available in case you are reading this ( we dont think any kashmiri will dare to do so)

Instagram comments are now Enabled and we do not monited comments so we are not responsible,

## Changed Instagream Account
In past we used our dedicated instagram @rks_sairbeen as we no longer offically maintain this project we have deleted our instagram account.
We will now stream on our main instagram account @wansawinc ( https://instagram.com/wansawinc ) 

-- Also we have deleted all accounts i.e Facebook, Youtube, TikTok, Dailymotion, VK, and all other,
